        <h3>Origins of Football</h3>    
        </header>

        <p>Records trace the origins of Football back more than <strong>2,000 years ago</strong> to <b>Ancient China, 
            Greece and Rome</b>, where the <b>'ball'</b> was made out of rock or animal hide stuffed with hair. 
            There were suggestions it dates even further back to old <b>Mesoamerican cultures</b> - 
            but <b>'football'</b> has its roots in <strong>19th century England</strong>.</p>

        <p>From England, the idea of Football spread to Europe and across the Atlantic. 
            Two schoolteachers, <b><em>August Hermann</em></b> and <b><em>Konrad Koch</em></b>, introduced the game to Germany circa 1874. 
            Immigrants, meanwhile, are thought to have brought soccer to the United States.</p>

        <p>The first football association was formed in <b>England</b> in <strong>1863</strong>. 
            Rules were established - but continued to change - and the size 
            and weight of the match-ball standardised. Crucially, carrying the ball 
            with the hands was outlawed: association Football and Rugby became two separate entities.</p>
        
        <p><b>Football</b> continued to undergo rapid development into the <strong>1900s</strong>, 
            accelerated by industrialisation. Public school teams soon became 
            the minority following the emergence of factory and other work-based clubs. 
            The best players received monetary incentives, and tickets were sold to the public - 
            mainly members of the working-class - for matches.</p>

        <h3>The English Football League</h3>
        </header>
        
        <p>Domestic leagues became commonplace around the world - the <b>English Football League</b> 
        being the first professional division. In Germany, football was played at an amateur level until 1949, 
        when semi-professional leagues were introduced. The country's first professional division, the <b>Bundesliga</b>, 
        started in <strong>1963/64</strong>. Forty-six clubs from the former West Germany applied for admission to the new league. 
        Sixteen were selected based on their sporting track record, economic criteria and representation of the 
        various sub-regional leagues. Until <strong>2001</strong>, the Bundesliga was directly under the auspices of the
         <b>Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB or German Football Association)</b>. This changed with the formation of the 
         <b>Deutsche Fußball-Liga (DFL or German Football League)</b>.</p>

        <p>The <b>UEFA European Football Championship</b>, more commonly known as the <b>Euros</b>, 
            is the primary association football competition contested by the senior 
            men's national teams of the members of the <b>Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)</b>, 
            determining the continental champion of Europe. It is held every four years, 
            in the even-numbered year between World Cups. The first edition took place in <strong>1960</strong>. 
            The <b>CONCACAF Gold Cup</b>, the main association football competition of the men's national football teams 
            governed by <b>The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF)</b>, 
            determining the continental champion of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean, is staged every two years.</p>

        <p>Today 211 national associations are members of <b>FIFA</b>, football's world governing body. 
            The world regions are divided into six confederations: <b>Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF)</b>, 
            <b>Asian Football Confederation (AFC)</b>, <b>UEFA</b>, <b>CONCACAF</b>, <b>Oceania Football Confederation (OFC)</b>, 
            and <b>Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL)</b>. While 32 countries took part in World Cup qualifying in <strong>1934</strong>, 
            that number has risen to over 200, reflecting football’s standing as a truly global phenomenon.</p>
