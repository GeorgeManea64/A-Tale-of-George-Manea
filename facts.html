    <ul>
        <li><b>Goalkeeper:</b> This player stands in front of the goal and tries to stop the ball from going into the net. 
        They wear special gloves and often have a different colour football shirts from the rest of the team.</li>
        
        <li><b>Defenders:</b> These players are like the protectors of the goal. They try to stop the other team from getting 
        close to their goal. There are usually two or three defenders, and they work together to block the other team’s 
        players and take the ball away from them.</li>
        
        <li><b>Midfielders:</b> These players run up and down the field, helping both the defence and the offence. 
        They pass the ball between teammates and try to control the flow of the game.</li>   
        
        <li><b>Forwards:</b> These players are the goal scorers. They try to get the ball past the other team’s 
        defenders and kick it into the opponent’s goal. They’re usually very fast and good at shooting the ball accurately.</li>
